## **Burning tool**
You need to use the Command-line Tool to burn the system image. If you are using Windows, you can also choose a batch burning tool with a GUI interface.

## **1.1. Batch Tool for Windows**

**Windows version (no installation required, just extract and run):**

### **1.2- Load OS file**

- To use the UNIHIKER Batch Tool, open the UNIHIKERBatchTool.exe file as an administrator and click on the Load button. Select the system image (img) file and the file path will be displayed below.

!!! note
    The V2.3 image burning tool now includes a file verification function. After loading the system file, the md5 verification will be performed on the file, which may take between 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the computer's performance. If the md5 value after the file name is inconsistent, it will prompt that the image is damaged.

### **1.3- Enter firmware flashing mode**

- Before using the batch tool, please disconnect the UNIHIKER from the power source and remove the memory card.
- To enter firmware flashing mode, hold down the Home button on the board and connect it to your computer via USB cable. The board will display a white screen and should be recognized as a new device by the software.
- Once the software has recognized the board as a new device, you can release the Home button. If you need to flash multiple boards at the same time, simply repeat the steps above for each board.

### **1.4- Start burning**

- Once the board to be flashed is recognized, click on "Burn" to begin the firmware flashing process. If this is the first time connecting the board, the driver will be installed before flashing can begin.

!!! note
    While the firmware is being flashed, check the output information in the lower window. If it seems to be stuck at a certain step for more than 5 minutes, please refer to the troubleshooting section at the end of the page for possible solutions.

### **1.5- Burning Completed**

- If you are flashing multiple boards, you will need to wait for each one to reach 100% or prompt an error before proceeding. Once the progress reaches 100%, the firmware flashing process is complete.

### **1.6- Install System**

- Once the firmware has finished flashing, click on "Install" to begin the installation process. The software will control all UNIHIKERs to restart and complete the installation of the new system.
- The new system will be automatically installed on the UNIHIKER, and it may restart multiple times during the process, which usually takes about one minute. Once the installation is complete, the board will stay on the language selection screen.
- During the installation process, please do not operate or power off the board. If a mistake is made, please re-flash the system.

## **2.1- Command-line Tool**

Unihiker's CPU is made by Rockchip, so we can use Rockchip's tool and execute commands to burn the system image.

### **2.2- File Preparation**
To burn the OS for Unihiker, you need to prepare three files:  
1. The img file of Unihiker's OS image.  
2. The loader boot bin file of Unihiker.  
3. rkdeveloptool file suitable for your platform.  

- file 1 can be downloaded from the official Unihiker documentation, which is universally compatible with all platforms
