| --- | --- |
| A | Unihiker's system provides a command to adjust the backlight: `brightness xxx`. For example, to set the brightness to 50%, simply input the command `brightness 50` in the terminal. Please note that to prevent mistakenly assuming the screen is damaged after turning off, the brightness adjustment will reset after restarting Unihiker. |
