| **Q** | **What should I do if the UNIHIKER's screen remains black after powering it on for 10s?** |
| --- | --- |
| A | 1. Check the POWER and USER lights on the back of the UNIHIKER. If the POWER light is not on, it means that the board is not powered, and you need to check whether the USB port is working, try changing the USB port or the USB cable. Additionally, make sure that the UNIHIKER is directly connected to the USB port of a PC or a power bank via a USB cable without an extension cable or docking station.
2. If the POWER light is on, check the USER light. If the USER light is not flashing, it means that the system has not started successfully. Try replugging the USB cable. If the problem persists, try **brun OS image** to UNIHIKER again.

3. If the POWER light is constantly on, the USER light is flashing, but the UNIHIKER's screen is still black, try **brun OS image** to UNIHIKER. If the problem persists, join the UNIHIKER official channel or contact the purchase channel for technical support. . |
