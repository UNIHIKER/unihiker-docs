Welcome to UNIHIKER! Before you start controlling the world around you, you'll need to set up the software to program your board.

The mentioned software can be interacted with UNIHIKER using the Python language.

 If you are new to programming, you can also start directly from Jupyter Notebook, which eliminates the need for you to go through the software installation process.Alternatively, start with MindPlus, which allows programming in a graphical way without the need to write code.

Select your preferred choice and continue with the quickstart.
